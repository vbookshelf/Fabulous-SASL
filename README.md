It's often hard for students to recall what the sign is for a particular word. Because many hearing students actually don't know anyone in the deaf community they don't have anyone who can help them outside class. A few years ago we created this web app to help students practice at home. It contains more than 1500 videos of the signs taught in the two levels that make up the Rhema Church sign language course.

There are many variations of sign language in different parts of the world. I've released the code so that it can be used as a template to help others create similar sign language learning tools. 

This non-profit project was completed over about 18 months. The coding is the quick part. Most of the work involves recording, editing and compressing the videos. This can be a daunting task if, like me, you know nothing about recording and editing videos. 

You don't need a fancy video camera. The videos can be recorded using a phone or tablet. One thing I suggest is not to record one sign at a time - working that way will take forever to finish. Rather stick a list of words just below the camera and ask the person being recorded to sign all the words on the list in sequence. Later the video can be cut up into different words and, especially if you are not a sign language expert, the list will help you know which word goes with which sign. Name each video file using the word e.g. hello.mp4. 

You don't need an expensive server account to host this app. It can be hosted on a cheap shared hosting account in the same way that many static websites are hosted. Good luck.
