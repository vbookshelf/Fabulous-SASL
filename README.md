A few years ago we created this web app to help sign language students practice at home. It contains more than 1500 videos of the signs taught in the Rhema Church sign language course.

There are many variations of sign language in different parts of the world. This code can be used as a template to create similar sign language learning tools. 

This non-profit project took about 18 months to complete. The coding is the quick part. Most of the work involves recording, editing and compressing the videos.

You don't need a fancy video camera. The videos can be recorded using a phone or a tablet. One thing I suggest is not to record one sign at a time - working that way will take a long time to finish. Rather stick a list of words just below the camera and ask the person being recorded to sign all the words on the list in sequence. Later the video can be cut up into different words. For reference you should number each list and also say the number out loud at the start of each recording. When editing the videos, these lists will help you know which word goes with which sign. Name each video file using the word being signed e.g. hello.mp4.

You don't need an expensive server account to host this app. It can be hosted using a shared hosting account in the same way that many static websites are hosted. Good luck.
